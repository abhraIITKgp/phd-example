# Example repository for a PhD project

This repository is an example of how to use Github as a powerful git-backed PhD notebook.

Each task or small project is contained in a subdirectory of the repository:

 - [01-first-task](./01-first-task)
 - [02-second-task](./02-second-task)
 - [03-third-task](./03-third-task)

The final thesis documented is written inside the [thesis](./thesis) directory.
